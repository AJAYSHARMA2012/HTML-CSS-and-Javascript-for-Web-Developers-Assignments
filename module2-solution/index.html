  		<p class="content">In grammar, a future tense (abbreviated fut) is a verb form that generally marks the event described by the verb as not having happened yet, but expected to happen in the future. An example of a future tense form is the French aimera, meaning "will love", derived from the verb aimer ("love").</p>
